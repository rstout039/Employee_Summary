# Employee_Summary
This is an app that will generate a webpage that display's a company's team's basic info. <br>
The user will therefore have quick access to the team members' emails and Github profiles. <br>
This app includes a package.json that requires user to install the Inquirer and Jest npm packages. <br>
User will be prompted with a series of questions that will then generate an engineering team consisting of a manager, an engineer, and an intern. <br> 
Each team member will display their information: <br>
Name <br>
Role in company <br>
ID <br>
Role-specific property <br>
Property for manager will be their office number. <br>
Property for Engineer will be their Github profile. <br> 
Property for Intern will be their school. <br>
After the user has input all their information they will be asked if they want to add more employees to the team. <br>
The user will then be asked to input their information related to the role until they wish to stop adding employees to the team. <br>
Jest will run the provided tests and Inquirer will collect input from the user. <br>
Templates for the webpage include: <br>
Main.html <br>
Enigneer.html <br>
Intern.html <br> 
Manager.html <br>
